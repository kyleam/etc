The configuration files in this repo are organized by topic and linked
to their appropriate locations using [stow][1] (an approach that has
been nicely [described][2] by Brandon Invergo.) If you're interested in
keeping your configuration files in git without using symbolic links,
have a look at [vcsh][3].
